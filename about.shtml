                                I graduated at Howest - University of Applied Sciences in 2023 majoring in Independent Game Production.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I picked this major because I am interested in several aspects of the game production process. My liking for programming stems from my younger years, but in my previous studies this liking grew into a passion. I have always liked drawing and making new or cool looking things.Â The combination of these topics meant that independent game development was not a hard choice for me to make.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Of course, like most other game dev's, I don't just like making games but I also like playing them. Ever since I was a little boy gaming has been a part of my life. either in the form of single-player games, multiplayer games, and last but definitely not least... board games.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Aside from gaming and computers, I also like music... generic right? Well, yeah I guess. Music's great and even though I don't do it nearly enough, jamming to a real banger on the drums is pretty great too.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                As I have mentioned above I have already graduated in another sector. I have a bachelor's degree in Electronics/ICT. This is where I learned the basics of programming and also how software and hardware are connected. This is one of the many random topics that for some reason I find very fascinating.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Currently I am also employed in this industry as an embedded software engineer.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                So that's me in a nutshell. And even though you can't say everything about yourself in just a couple of lines I'd say now you know me a little better.
