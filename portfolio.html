                    <p>
                        This is my most recent project. Since a lot of the projects on the website are stylised and game related I decided to try realism.<br>
                        A friend of mine is moving and would like to do some renovations, so for helping him decide on some stuff I tried my hand at making some procedural, 
                        realistic materials.

                    <p>
                        This project is something very different. This is a project in which I wanted to design a special input device. 
                        I have a background in electronics so the fun thing to do was to combine this background with gaming!<br>
                        Introducing "The Orb"! A device that replaces your computer mouse in a very unnecessary way!

                        This is a small prototype game I made to get a bit more acquainted with player feedback and game feel. 
                        The gameplay is fairly simple and there's not a whole lot to do, but the game still feels great to play.

                    <p>
                        Disconnected is a game I designed for the game design class in school. The Idea is that you control two spheres which are connected to each other. 
                        The player must complete levels to reach a cutting machine that will disconnect them.<br>
                        In this project I focussed on, and learned about gameplay, player feedback, replayability and I tried my hand at some basic shaders.

                        This is a small game I made with a couple of fun extra's. 
                        One of the features I am proud of is the ability to import an Image to load it as a level in the game. <br>
                        The pixels are turned into tiles and the tiles are then combined into longer rectangles to improve performance and gameplay.

                    <p>
                        For my Graduation work I decided to do research into a specific shader. 
                        Cross hatching is an old drawing technique where shading is created by drawing parallel lines in different densities or thicknesses.<br>

                        The topic of my research was to recreate this art style in 3D using a shader.<br>

                        The end result is shown on the right, but if you want more details you can click the gif as well.

                        For my internship I was given the opportunity to port an app that the company had created to an entirely new platform. The Meta Quest 2.<br>

                        This was my first time developing for a VR device, and I am certainly pleased with how the game turned out.

                    <p>
                        This was a school project for our 2D class. The idea was that we design a character, and afterwards animate it so it could be used in an endless runner game. 
                        Additionally I designed some assets to create a skin for the endless runner.<br>

                        The 2D animation in particular came out well in this project.<br>

                        Skully is a Game I made with a couple of friends for a halloween Game jam. 
                        I did a part of gameplay programming and some 3D asset design. 
                        It's not the best game, but I feel like it was not too shabby for a game jam made in a just a couple of days.<br><br>
